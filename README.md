# Dirty-Cafe-Sales-Dataset
The Dirty Cafe Sales dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in a cafe. This dataset is intentionally "dirty," with missing values, inconsistent data, and errors introduced to provide a realistic scenario for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)..

# Brief
The Dirty Cafe Sales Dataset provides a realistic scenario for practicing:
• Data cleaning and preprocessing
• Handling missing, inconsistent, and erroneous values
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Feature engineering
• Business insight extraction
• This project focuses on transforming raw, messy data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis and reporting

# DataSet
The dataset used in this project is the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training  The dataset represents cafe sales transactions and intentionally contains errors and inconsistencies

# How_It_Works

• load the Dirty Cafe Sales Dataset from Kaggle
• Inspect data to identify missing and inconsistent values
• Clean data by replacing invalid entries with NaN and fixing data types
• Engineer new features such as month and day from transaction dates
• Perform EDA to analyze product performance and sales trends
• Extract insights and prepare a clean dataset for analysis


# Tools & Libraries
I. VS Code
II. Python 3.x
III. pandas, numpy
